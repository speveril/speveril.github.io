Gruedorf Progress:
- decided that I needed an actual game to test out my visual novel prototype, came up with an idea for one
- started to lay out the game with sketchy "pencil" drawings

This week has been a little crazy for me, so I've gotten a bit of Gruedorf stuff done (though less than I'd like) but no big post. Oh well! The weekly post must go on.

At some point I need to explain more about what I'm actually building. I probably should have done that earlier. Truth is, I'm at a weird point right now with multiple projects. Soon, I hope, I'll have something to actually talk about and for you to play with.
